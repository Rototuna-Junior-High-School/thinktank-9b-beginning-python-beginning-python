# Course Overview 📚

In this course, you will learn the basics of Python programming language and its concepts such as data types, variables, loops, functions, etc. You will also learn how to write and run simple programs and solve real-world problems.

# Setting Up Python in Visual Studio Code 💻

To get started with Python in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

- Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file with a .py extension.
- Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.
- Open the command pallette with `Ctl + shift + p`
- Change the default shell to `bash` by searching for `Terminal: Select Default Profile` in the command pallette 
- Start writing and running your Python code!

And that's it! You are now ready to start coding in Python with Visual Studio Code. Happy coding! 🎉

# About this repo

This repo contains all the tasks that you need to complete on the side. You will find the instructions at the top of each file. 

## Testing
Although you can complete these exercises without tests, they can be helpful to make sure your code works as expected. 

Tests live in the testing folder and you will need to install pytest to run them. `pip install pytest`

Once you think you have completed one of the tasks run the test for the file eg `python -m pytest tests/exercise-1/e1p1.py` in the command line.

To run all the test in a folder run `python -m pytest tests/exercise-1`
